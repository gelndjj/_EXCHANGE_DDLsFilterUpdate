# 📩 Dynamic DL Filter Updater

A PowerShell utility designed for IT administrators to **manage Dynamic Distribution Lists (DDLs)** in Exchange Online. It enables you to **generate reports**, **bulk update recipient filters**, and **preview (dry-run) which users would match those filters**, all via CSV.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Generate Report**: Export all DDLs with current filters, readable summaries, and email addresses.
- ✏️ **Edit and Re-Upload**: Modify recipient filters directly in the generated CSV and apply updates in bulk.
- 🔍 **Dry Run**: Simulate filter results and export matching recipients per DDL.
- 🧑‍💼 UPN fallback logic: If `UserPrincipalName` is missing, it falls back to `PrimarySmtpAddress`.

## 📢 Use Option 0 first to generate the template, then modify and reuse that same CSV for Options 1 and 2.
🧪 Example Filter

```txt
(Company -eq "Contoso") -and (RecipientTypeDetails -eq "UserMailbox") -and (ExchangeUserAccountControl -ne 'AccountDisabled')
```
You can copy filters from existing DDLs and adapt them as needed.
